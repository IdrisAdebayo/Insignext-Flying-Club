Insignext Flying club concepts was born in Fort Worth and works in collaboration with Delta Qualiflight Aviation Inc. of Fortworth, Texas, USA and International Aviation College, Ilorin propose to conduct Season-1 of our flying club activities with students in your reputable school in a bid to stimulate their interest in flying.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In our bid to address the current threat of global airline pilot shortage, we propose to enrol interested students of your school in either our Modular Professional Pilot Program for prospects over 17 years or Basic Flight Discovery Program for children between ages 13-16 years. These programs are specifically designed for teenagers who have the ambition backed by the passion to pursue   careers in aviation   and aerospace sciences.

‘The 2015 Boeing Pilot and Technician Outlook, a respectable industry forecast of personnel demand, projects that 558,000 new commercial airline pilots and 609,000 new maintenance technicians will be needed to fly and maintain the world fleet over the next 20 years’ (Source: Boeing Pilot and Technician Outlook)

STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
We embarked on a recruitment drive last year and our prime target was high school students with ambition to become airline pilots. We held seminars in various schools in Abuja FCT, Lagos and Kaduna states and some of our findings with interested students are: 
•	The total outlay of fees is a huge financial burden on most parents given the rapid slump of the naira to the dollar, also the recession
•	Parents of prospective pilots want their children to obtain university degrees before commencing flight training
•	Many interested children have not attained the minimum age required to obtain a pilot license (17 and 18 respectively for a Private and Commercial Pilot Licence) 
•	A number of prospects are presently enrolled in other programs in universities and other tertiary institutions
